### ðŸ§± Project Architecture & Technical Overview

- Database: **`Hive`** using the hive Flutter package.

- State Management: **`Cubit`** (flutter_bloc).

- Architecture Pattern: **`MVVM`** (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“ViewModel).

- Design Principles: Applied the **`Single Responsibility Principle`** for clean separation of concerns.

- **Dependency Injection**: Implemented using the get_it package to create singletons.

- **Repository Pattern**: Used to handle data access and business logic separation.

- **Clean Code Practices**: Structured, modular, and maintainable codebase following best practices.

- Navigation: Managed using a dedicated **`router`** for consistent and scalable navigation flow.



**`All user interactionsâ€”such as adding favorites, cart items, or selectionsâ€”are persistently stored in the local SQLite database using the sqflite package.`**
